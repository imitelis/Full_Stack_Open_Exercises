# Full Stack Open - Part 0 - Fundamentals of Web apps - Exercises


## Exercises 0.1.-0.6.

The exercises are submitted via GitHub, and by marking the exercises as done in the "my submissions" tab of the [submissions system](https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/stats/courses/fullstackopen).

You can submit all of the exercises into the same repository, or use multiple different repositories. If you submit exercises from different parts into the same repository, name your directories well. If you use a private repository to submit the exercises, add `mluukkai` as a collaborator to it.

One good way to name the directories in your submission repository is as follows:

```
part0
part1
  courseinfo
  unicafe
  anecdotes
part2
  courseinfo
  phonebook
  countries
```

So, each part has its own directory, which contains a directory for each exercise set (like the unicafe exercises in Part 1).

The exercises are submitted **one part at a time**. When you have submitted the exercises for a part, you can no longer submit any missed exercises for that part.

### 0.1: HTML

### 0.4: New note diagram

In the section [Loading a page containing JavaScript - review](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part0/fundamentals_of_web_apps#loading-a-page-containing-java-script-review), the chain of events caused by opening the page [https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/notes](https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/notes) is depicted as a [sequence diagram](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/unified-modeling-language-uml-sequence-diagrams/).

The diagram was made as a GitHub Markdown-file using the [Mermaid](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams)-syntax, as follows:

```
sequenceDiagram
    participant browser
    participant server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/notes
    activate server
    server-->>browser: HTML document
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.css
    activate server
    server-->>browser: the css file
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.js
    activate server
    server-->>browser: the JavaScript file
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The browser starts executing the JavaScript code that fetches the JSON from the server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/data.json
    activate server
    server-->>browser: [{ "content": "HTML is easy", "date": "2023-1-1" }, ... ]
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The browser executes the callback function that renders the notes
```

**Create a similar diagram** depicting the situation where the user creates a new note on the page [https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/notes](https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/notes) by writing something into the text field and clicking the <em>Save</em> button.

If necessary, show operations on the browser or on the server as comments on the diagram.

The diagram does not have to be a sequence diagram. Any sensible way of presenting the events is fine.

All necessary information for doing this, and the next two exercises, can be found in the text of [this part](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part0/fundamentals_of_web_apps#forms-and-http-post). The idea of these exercises is to read the text through once more and to think through what is going on there. Reading the application [code](https://github.com/mluukkai/example_app) is not necessary, but it is of course possible.

You can do the diagrams with any program, but perhaps the easiest and the best way to do diagrams is the [Mermaid](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid#sequence-diagram-docs---live-editor) syntax that is now implemented in [GitHub](https://github.blog/2022-02-14-include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/) Markdown pages!

### 0.5: Single page app diagram

Create a diagram depicting the situation where the user goes to the [single-page app](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part0/fundamentals_of_web_apps#single-page-app) version of the notes app at [https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/spa](https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/spa).

### 0.6: New note in Single page app diagram

Create a diagram depicting the situation where the user creates a new note using the single-page version of the app.

This was the last exercise, and it's time to push your answers to GitHub and mark the exercises as done in the [submissions system](https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/stats/courses/fullstackopen).
